Title: Program/Project Director - Megaprojects
Location: Nigeria
Sector: Program Development

SUMMARY
I am a Project or Program Director, Program/Design/Construction/Project Management professional, with over 37 years experience. During my career to date, I have completed in total, approximately $3 Billion Dollars (BUSD) as either the project superintendent, project manager, or in the case of design/build (EPC) scenarios, as the program manager, project general manager, or project director. As VP of Project Management (or as what would normally be considered either a project executive (Px) or director (Pd) role), I have managed other PM professionals, in the pre-construction of another $ 4.5 BUSD and then the completed construction of yet another $2.5 BUSD, for a grand total of $5.5 BUSD overall (Pre-Construction not included).

My largest “completed” project to date, was a 1,500 acre, mixed use real estate development, modeled after the New York City business core, centering around Central Park, for a South Korean subsidiary of a US Based, NYC Real Estate Developer. I was there for years 3 and 4, of an ultimate 12 year project, and at a time when our monthly construction draws grew from $35 MUSD to $62 MUSD per month. My current largest Project to date (which is still passing through Project Staging) is a 14,400 hectare (over 30,000 acres) industrial city, which will focus on Gas and Oil, Marine and Shipping, and derivatives based manufacturing (from both Oil and Gas), as its market drivers, all based upon a 25 year Detailed Master Plan. I have worked extensively with the “Real Options Analysis” MBA finance technique as applied to managing the Project Shaping portion of these huge and politically charged mega-projects, as the principal tool leading towards consensus building among the widely varied project stakeholder and/or consortia groups as they work their way towards ultimate Project Anchoring.

New Songdo City	New Songdo City (Incheon)South Korea

$35 BUSD (Development)

Project was “New Songdo City”, which consisted of a 1,500 acre, $35 Billion USD, mixed use development. There were 157 separate building structures, ranging from 67 story residential apartment buildings, to 65 story office towers, to the mid-rise 32 story towers, located at the outer edge of the development. The development also included a 2,500 student, 225 teacher, International School, a Jack Nicklaus golf course, club house and villas, museum, ecotarium, and several functional canals, including water taxis. This city was constructed on reclaimed land from the Yellow Sea, and was built on Incheon harbor dredging spoils, requiring several very specific geo-technical processes, for either the utilities and roadway improvements, the individual building developments, or both. There were well over 40 km of roadways and utilities galleries within this project 

Key accomplishments:

a.	Responsible for the full completion of the PM group’s operational procedures (i.e., the project manual), as well as the long-term and substantial modification and optimization of the Korean PMIS Web based Project Management System, for use on this jobsite (this was the project-wide “e-collaboration” software system, which combined some of the project management features and tools of Constructware and Web-based Prolog). This system included schema mapping for workflows, and at its peak had 3,000 registered users, and an average user base of 500 users per day. It effectively made the project near “paperless”, resulting in the elimination of document controllers, in exchange for a single system administrator.

b.	Responsible for the design and operation of the PM’s NTC, DN and NCR and QA/QC system, through PMIS. .

a.	Responsible for the completion of the Joint Venture’s operational procedures (i.e., the project manual), as well as the optimization of Prolog Web use on this jobsite (which included hard hat mounted webcams which were connected to field-based wireless tablets for field engineers and QC inspectors).

b.	Responsible for the building, and maintenance of the relationship with the client and owner, such that no bonding was required of this JV CM-at-risk operation.

c.	Responsible for the design and operation of the JV’s NTC, NCR, DN and QA/QC sys-tem, through Prolog, which utilized wireless webcams and tablets, for documentation support of the system, by superintendents and assistant superintendents (considered to be a “pervasive” system, or also known as Wearable Computing).

d.	Responsible for all training, “what-if” and Problem Solving working sessions with the Minority Concrete Subcontractor for the Convention Center. The concrete beams and girders for this building were massive, and utilized both bonded, and un-bonded post-tensioning as their reinforcement. Coordination between the disciplines, and between the trades was very complex due to very tight tolerances.

International Project Manager
 - Infilco Degremont, Inc.
2002 – 2004 (2 years)
Waadi Ma’in Reverse Osmosis Water Plant Dead Sea & Amman, Jordan
& Pipeline

$140 MUSD TIC Project

Project consisted of a $140 Million USD, USAID funded, 6,000 m3 per day, reverse osmosis potable water plant, which received its feed water from three of the principal Jordanian Wadi’s (streams), upstream from the Dead Sea’s east side. This was a classic, Global Virtual Project Team, with Engineer, Procure, Construct, or Management members, in Richmond, VA, USA, Rueil Malmassion, Paris, France, Balboa, Spain, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Amman, Jordan. The project team was a Joint Venture between IDI (parent company was Degremont/Suez in Paris) and Morganti, (parent company was CCC in Athens). 

Key accomplishments:

a.	Helped to complete the development, verification and optimization of the company’s Livelink based E-Collaboration system, which also included “live” schema mapping” in conjunction with Prolog or Constructware-like Project Controls Software tools, all of which were custom designed for large, global virtual teaming projects, for this company.

b.	Participated in the “re-engineering” of the American subsidiary company’s operational procedures, many of which were 45 years old, and were no longer compatible with ei-ther current computer technology, or the demands of Global Virtual Project Teaming.

This was a classic consortia project, consisting of the Owner's group (Citgo, Conoco, Vista and Gulf States Utilities), and an integrated PM Group (Bechtel, Becon, and Heery), with project staff including mixed members from both the Owner's and PM groups.

Key accomplishments:

a. Was able to perform successfully from the project's groundbreaking, until the final project close-out (was actually the last man standing on the project as project site offices were removed from the project). This project was a highly political consortia, with only a few professionals able to navigate this project's unique idiosyncrasies, from start to finish.

b. Responsible for the design and development of the project's Paradox Database ""linked tables"" system for our PM tools (i.e., Management of Change, MoM's, Issues Log, Action Items Log, Document Control, Daily Reports, etc.).

 Note: Such related applications software such as Prolog or Constructware would not be developed or available ""off-the-shelf"" until well after the completion of this project, and as such it was commonplace during this era to build your own custom Paradox or Access based system.

c. Designed, developed and issued the various Project Metrics, which were the indicators for measuring success or failure for safety, quality, cost and schedule. ""Communication is the Key"" banners were printed and posted throughout all of the various project office trailer compounds, with the project metrics shown.

d. Designed and issued the monthly ""NISCO Chatter"" project newsletter,

SUMMARY
I am an ARB-UK Registered Architect, with a vast working experience in high-end design studios of seven years in the UK and Ireland and of eight years in The Netherlands, Italy and Portugal. 

My work spans all scales, from interior design to single family houses, residential and mixed-use schemes, offices, schools, hospitals, civic buildings, urban design and master planning throughout all the project design and construction phases (RIBA stages A-L).

I am fully competent in AutoCAD, Microstation, REVIT and in most CAD/BIM/Graphic software packages. I am passionate about hand sketching, model making and information graphics.

Being a gregarious person, my client facing skills and managing/working within teams of all sizes are natural to me.

I am always interested to hear from forward-thinking companies that have a strong design culture and that put people and communities at the centre of Architecture. I am always willing to take part and put my expertise of many years at the service of inspirational and challenging projects.

PROJECTS

Biotic Studio
Starting November 2014
Biotic {The Living} Studio is involved in bringing human-centred design to urbanisation. We focus our design services on developing smart, sustainable cities which engage with their human occupants. By using data analytics and digital strategies combined with architecture and urban design thinking we can model effects that humans have on the city ecosystem and cities effects on human urbanisations. We ask the question: how do humans affect one another and the city they live in? Our goal is to design smart and sustainable cities for their occupants and we do so utilising techniques such as user experience research, green architecture, urban design and city information modelling (CIM).

Biotic Studio's main components are the living things that shape the cities ecosystem and we believe that a biotic factor is any living component that affects the ecosystem {the living city}.
